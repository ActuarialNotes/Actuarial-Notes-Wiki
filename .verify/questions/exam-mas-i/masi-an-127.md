- checks_run: blind: ratios 1.200, 0.990, 0.980, 1.019, 0.900; worst quintile 1 -> 1.20 = E = key; A inverted 0.83, B largest dollar gap (Q5) 0.90, C overall 2,161/2,200 = 0.98, D 780/702 = 1.11; key present among options/answer form valid; tags and learning_objective checked
- sources_checked: Goldburd, Khare, Tevet & Guller, Generalized Linear Models for Insurance Rating, CAS Monograph 5, 2nd ed. (rank 3 for MAS-I), §7.2.1 Simple Quantile Plots, PDF p.87 (sort by predicted, equal-exposure quantiles, actual vs predicted; criteria predictive accuracy, monotonicity, vertical distance between first and last quantiles = lift), sha256:89b203ea55208911c4d8f6ef1ede4dd6c0206d47999b5e8aff96fe233c0ff757 — https://www.casact.org/sites/default/files/2021-01/05-Goldburd-Khare-Tevet.pdf; CAS Exam MAS-I Content Outline 2026 (MASI_CO_2026_F v06), Domain C 'Extended Linear Models' tasks 1-9 (PDF p.5); Complete Text References: Dobson & Barnett Ch 1-9, Hogg 9.1-9.6, James et al.

- note: Original vault question (question-writer skill) - no publisher's key. Verified medium, the precedent for vault-written questions (Exam P p-901..p-964): independent blind recomputation (rank 5) agreeing with the key, every distractor and explanation step checked, and each method/fact confirmed against the cited open sources (MAS-I readings ISLR/Larsen where they cover it, otherwise rank-3 open references). wiki_link tags each tested by the question; learning_objective 'Extended Linear Models' is the exam page's Domain C callout title (as on the verified MAS-I paper questions) and the topic sits under Domain C on the page.
