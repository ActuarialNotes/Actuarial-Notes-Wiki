- checks_run: Re-fetched the PDF 2026-10-09: sha256 identical to the page's syllabus block. Topic titles, weights, objectives, outcomes and bullets: syllabus_lint fidelity (word for word vs extracted JSON) 0 errors; syllabus_write --check: page = render of JSON. Independently, every prose, objective and reading line on the page (links stripped, punctuation-normalised) located in the PDF text layer; the only lines not found are the app-composed 'Outcomes …' sub-bullets and the PDF's own two-column table (PA's ISLR edition table, matched cell by cell). Sitting: soa.org's study page links this exact PDF.
