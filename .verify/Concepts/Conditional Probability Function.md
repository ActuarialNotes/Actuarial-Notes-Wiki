- checks_run: Diff against 0287511f read in full: additions only, no prior sentence changed; earlier content and its prior sources (re-cited) unchanged; new wiki-links resolve; LaTeX balanced; no question numbers, scenario or wording on the page (compared with the items' question files). Kernel bullet: conditional = joint / marginal of the conditioning variable, which is the normalizing constant (Siegrist 3.5, verbatim), so the conditional is proportional to the joint with y fixed.
