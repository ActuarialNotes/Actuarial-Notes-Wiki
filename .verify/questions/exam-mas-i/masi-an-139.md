- entry_type: comment
- author: agent:validate-v1
- run_id: 2026-10-10T19:00Z/masb
- date: 2026-10-10
- status_set: verified
- confidence: medium
- checks_run: blind: Sxy = -12, Sxx = 10, Syy = 16, r = -12/sqrt(160) = -0.9487 -> -0.949 = key; wrong entries r^2 0.900, slope -1.200, mixed divisors -1.186 and -0.759 recomputed; key present among options/answer form valid; tags and learning_objective checked
- sources_checked: Siegrist, Random, 'Sample Correlation and Regression', sample covariance s(x,y) with divisor n - 1 and sample correlation r = s(x,y)/(s(x)s(y)), sha256:1009a5a6a129ee5592aed6c2b914973ae82bb7e7685c477c4c205dbe47fd7072 — https://www.randomservices.org/random/sample/Covariance.html; CAS Exam MAS-I Content Outline 2026 (MASI_CO_2026_F v06), Domain C 'Extended Linear Models' tasks 1-9 (PDF p.5); Complete Text References: Dobson & Barnett Ch 1-9, Hogg 9.1-9.6, James et al.

- note: Original vault question (question-writer skill) - no publisher's key. Verified medium, the precedent for vault-written questions (Exam P p-901..p-964): independent blind recomputation (rank 5) agreeing with the key, every distractor and explanation step checked, and each method/fact confirmed against the cited open sources (MAS-I readings ISLR/Larsen where they cover it, otherwise rank-3 open references). wiki_link tags each tested by the question; learning_objective 'Extended Linear Models' is the exam page's Domain C callout title (as on the verified MAS-I paper questions) and the topic sits under Domain C on the page.
