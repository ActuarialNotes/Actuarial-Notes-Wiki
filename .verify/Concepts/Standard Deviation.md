- checks_run: sigma = sqrt(Var) vs G&S sec. 6.2 (D(X) = sqrt V(X)) and Pishro-Nik sec. 3.2.4 (SD in the units of X, variance not); sqrt(E[X^2] - E[X]^2) vs G&S Thm 6.6; sigma(aX+b) = |a| sigma(X) as the square root of G&S Thm 6.7; syllabus LO d. Example recomputed before reading the answer: 50000 - 200^2 = 10000, sigma = 100, agrees. Links and embed resolve; LaTeX well formed.
