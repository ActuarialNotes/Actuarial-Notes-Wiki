# Canadian P&C Insurance Research Corpus — Vault Coverage Plan

Target: the **markdown vault** (`Resources/Regulation/`, `Resources/Events/`,
`Resources/Books/`, and a new `Resources/Benchmarks/`), not the Supabase
`research_documents` corpus. Every topic below becomes one vault page with
YAML frontmatter that includes a link to its source (PDF, website, or book).
This is fully executable from a coding session — no Supabase credentials
needed, just research + `git commit`.

374 topics, organized into 18 sections (same groupings as the original plan).

## Target schema A — `Resources/Regulation/`, `Resources/Events/`, `Resources/Benchmarks/`

Extends the existing `Resources/Regulation/*.md` / `Resources/Events/*.md`
frontmatter (see `Creation of OSFI (1987).md`, `IFRS 17 Global Accounting
Implementation (2023).md`) with three new fields:

```yaml
---
id: <reg|event|bench>-<jurisdiction>-<year>-<slug>
title: "..."
type: regulation | event | benchmark
status: effective | pending | superseded | historical
date: YYYY-MM-DD
published_date: YYYY-MM-DD        # optional, if different from effective date
jurisdiction: "CA" | "CA-ON" | "CA-AB" | "CA-QC" | "CA-BC" | "CA-MB" | "CA-SK" | ...
lob: ["P&C"]                       # or ["Auto-Personal","Auto-Commercial"], ["Property"], etc.
issuing_body: "..."
impact_level: high | medium | low
impacted_agents: [...]
tags: [...]
aliases: [...]
source_url: "https://..."          # NEW — primary source (regulator page, PDF, press release)
source_type: pdf | webpage | dataset | filing   # NEW
pdf_url: "https://..."             # NEW, optional — direct PDF if source_url is an HTML landing page
---
```

`type: benchmark` is new — used for `Resources/Benchmarks/`.

## Target schema B — `Resources/Books/`

Existing schema already has a source-link field (`Available from`); no new
fields needed. Used for CIA educational notes, PACICC/insurer reports,
investor decks, and recurring corporate filings — things that are "documents
to cite" rather than dated regulatory/timeline events.

```yaml
---
Title: "..."
Author: "..."          # issuing body / company
Publisher: "..."
Type: "Educational Note" | "Annual Report" | "MD&A" | "Investor Presentation" | "Press Release" | "Report"
Code: "..."             # optional (e.g. CIA document number)
Available from: "[host](https://...)"
---
```

## Phase 0 — repo prep (do first, small code task)

- [ ] Create `Resources/Benchmarks/` directory
- [ ] Add `{ dir: 'Resources/Benchmarks', kind: 'benchmark' }` to `TIMELINE_SOURCES` in `quiz/vite.config.ts`
- [ ] Verify `type: benchmark` flows through `ResourceHeatmap.tsx` / `ResourceMonthCards.tsx` / `ConceptPopup` reader (TimelineKind already includes it per the comment in vite.config.ts — confirm no UI gap)
- [ ] Note the new `source_url` / `source_type` / `pdf_url` frontmatter fields somewhere durable (CLAUDE.md or a short note at the top of `Resources/Regulation/`)

## How to use this plan

1. Work section by section. Each `- [ ]` is one vault page.
2. Most fields (`jurisdiction`, `issuing_body`, default `lob`, target
   directory) are declared **once per section** — only deviations are called
   out per item.
3. `src: TBD` means the source URL still needs to be found — that's the bulk
   of the remaining work, and is pure web research (good for batched,
   separate sessions/agents).
4. `(dup?)` flags items that may already exist as a `Resources/Regulation/*.md`
   or `Resources/Events/*.md` page — verify before creating a new one.
5. Filenames should follow the existing convention: `<Title> (<Year>).md`.
