- date: 2026-10-10
- status_set: verified
- confidence: medium
- checks_run: blind: IQR proportional to median -> SD proportional to mean -> V(mu) = mu^2 -> gamma, log link -> A = key; Poisson V = mu, Normal constant, Tweedie mass at zero, inverse Gaussian V = mu^3 (spread x 2^1.5 = 2.8); key present among options/answer form valid; tags and learning_objective checked

- note: Original vault question (question-writer skill) - no publisher's key. Verified medium, the precedent for vault-written questions (Exam P p-901..p-964): independent blind recomputation (rank 5) agreeing with the key, every distractor and explanation step checked, and each method/fact confirmed against the cited open sources (MAS-I readings ISLR/Larsen where they cover it, otherwise rank-3 open references). wiki_link tags each tested by the question; learning_objective 'Extended Linear Models' is the exam page's Domain C callout title (as on the verified MAS-I paper questions) and the topic sits under Domain C on the page.
