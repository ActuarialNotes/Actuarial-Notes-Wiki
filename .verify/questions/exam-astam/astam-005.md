## [F-001] SOA printed slip kept as printed; marker added
- entry_type: finding
- author: agent:validate-v1
- run_id: 2026-10-23T18:24Z/0b13
- date: 2026-10-23
- severity: minor
- status: open
- locus: Part c, stem
- claim: Stem reads "the alpha(n)-Expected Shortfall of X is ES_alpha(X) = 1 + log n" with no marker.
- evidence: SOA ASTAM sample questions p.9, Q5(c), prints ES subscripted alpha (not alpha(n)), while the same sentence names the alpha(n)-Expected Shortfall and part (d)(ii) and the solution (p.12) write ES_alpha(n)(X). Kept as printed; "(as printed)" added.
- source_rank: 1
- proposed_action: Keep as printed with an (as printed) marker (P1).
- applied: true
- fingerprint: cff16898de85

## [C-001] Validation pass — verified
- entry_type: comment
- author: agent:validate-v1
- run_id: 2026-10-23T18:24Z/0b13
- date: 2026-10-23
- status_set: verified
- confidence: high
- checks_run: independent recomputation of every computed part before reading the key and solution; stem, table and formula diff against the 130-dpi page images of the question PDF; explanation diff against the solution page images (method, figures, arithmetic, align* rows); frontmatter (type multi-part, wiki_link targets and topic page exist, validate_content.py passes)
- sources_checked: SOA ASTAM Sample Questions (version of Feb. 23, 2026), Q5, pp.9-10, sha256:0294cf4e8717191cda2747e7a6bb49fbb5e2d08f2d281ec979e670621de74ab4 — https://www.soa.org/globalassets/assets/files/edu/2024/spring/questions/february-2024-astam-questions.pdf; SOA ASTAM Solutions to Sample Questions, Q5, pp.12-13, sha256:c4206394603cf205da0668d40333bee5aaa6e3dadcaa241fdb03e5488a1ba4e1 — https://www.soa.org/globalassets/assets/files/edu/2024/spring/solutions/february-2024-astam-solutions.pdf
- note: Recomputed: 1 - 0.95^20 = 0.64151; Q = log n; ES = 1 + log n by memorylessness; E[M_n] approx log n + 0.5772 between them. Agree with the SOA. (d)(i) and (e) are prose, transcribed verbatim. Stem matches p.9 (p.10 blank). One SOA slip (ES_alpha for ES_alpha(n)) marked.
