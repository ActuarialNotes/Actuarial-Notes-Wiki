- checks_run: blind recompute before reading the key; stem, options and formulas diffed against the rendered booklet page; explanation diffed against the rendered SOA solution; answer key vs SOA key; wiki_link and topic targets exist; validate_content
- sources_checked: SOA Exam FAM-S sample questions (June 15, 2026), Q3, p.4, sha256:ef535e2198444052082114642e5884d8fe279975ebe7059abb363c5ecfcfd4de — https://www.soa.org/globalassets/assets/files/edu/2024/fall/questions/2024-10-exam-fam-s-sample-questions.pdf; SOA Exam FAM-S sample solutions (July 17, 2026), Q3, p.2, sha256:7b3f61d8c385f486f3dbc586cdaab035fe9c45a055710e8327d213c4d3e71b48 — https://www.soa.org/globalassets/assets/files/edu/2024/fall/solutions/2024-10-exam-fam-s-sample-solutions.pdf
- note: Blind recompute: mean 1.2262 < variance 1.9131; k n_k/n_(k-1) rising -> negative binomial (A); SOA key A, vault key A. Stem, options and every formula diffed against the rendered booklet page; explanation diffed line by line against the rendered solution page (same method and figures). Medium: the key is a model-selection judgment (which model 'best represents' the data), supported by both of the SOA's criteria.
