- entry_type: finding

- date: 2026-10-18
- severity: major
- status: open
- locus: MCT sub-bullet
- claim: The MCT calculation, showing Capital Available, Capital Required and the Base Solvency Buffer.
- evidence: OSFI Guideline A-4 (Dec 2017) p.3: 'For P&C insurers, the MICAT and the MCT guidelines define the capital requirement amount as the minimum capital required, while for life insurers the capital requirement amount is referred to as the Base Solvency Buffer in the LICAT.' A full-text search of the MCT guideline (2024) for 'base solvency buffer' returns 0 hits; its denominator is 'minimum capital required' = target-level capital required less the diversification credit, divided by 1.5 (§1.1.1-§1.1.2). OSFI Guideline A-4, Regulatory Capital and Internal Capital Targets (December 2017), p.3, sha256:f68346b481f701b9a9ccac13cac872c8e7c009c96d2a7a51b66e523c00e6b1fa — https://www.casact.org/sites/default/files/2021-03/6C_OSFI_Target_Capital.pdf; OSFI, Minimum Capital Test Guideline (2024), Guideline A, §1.1.1, §1.1.2, sha256:ec08c0d9b998c17749d099bdc0e96aeb4508a912b9a5d4eb390335602b03fd0e — https://www.osfi-bsif.gc.ca/en/guidance/guidance-library/minimum-capital-test-guideline-2024
- source_rank: 1
- proposed_action: Name the MCT's denominator as the guideline does - minimum capital required (target-level capital required less the diversification credit, divided by 1.5); the ratio arithmetic is otherwise unaffected where the figure is a given input.
